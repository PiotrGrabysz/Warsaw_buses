    "\n",
    "After dowloading the timetables as described in \"collect_data sample usage.ipynb\" I have an access to when and where each **brigade** should arrive. I could analyze if any bus of the given line has arrived at the stop at the time it should which means there could be no observed delay if the bus was so delayed that it land in the schedule of its subsequent bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to take another approach and anylyze the delays \"brigade-wise\". To see when the brigade arrived at the stop I would like to find the timestamp when the the brigade was closest the this stop. But if during the time of collecting the data this brigade went back to the final stop **and returned**, then it might passed this stop twice. To ensure that the timestamp of the closest timestamp is the right one I redefine the notion of \"closeness\" and add some time penalty to it. Let $x_{bus}$ be the bus position and $t_{bus}$ the corresponding timestamp and $x_{stop}$ the position of the stop, $t_{stop}$ the time when the bus should arrive at this stop. Then the distance between the bus and the stop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "dist_{new} = dist(x_{bus}, x_{stop}) + \\alpha \\cdot |t_{bus} - t_{stop}|\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $dist()$ is the normal distance in space (I use the haversine distance) and $\\alpha$ is a weight describing the time difference impact (it is set to 0.001 by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea to calculate the delay of each brigade is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ get the brigade's schedule: position of each stop the brigade goes to and the time when this brigade should arrive at this stop\n",
    "\n",
    "+ remove from the schedule rows with time of arrival earlier than the earliest time brigade's timestamp and later then the latest brigade's timestamp (if you collect the buses data from 15:00 to 16:00, consider only those in the schedule)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ for each stop find the bus $(x_{bus}^{*}, t_{bus}^{*})$ minimizing the $dist_{new}$ from the stop. Once this position is found, estimate the time needed to reach the stop from this position as follows:\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        delay = t_{bus}^{*} - t_{stop} + \\frac{dist(x_{bus}^{*}, x_{stop})}{v_{max}}\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $\\frac{dist(x_{bus}^{*}, x_{stop})}{v_{max}}$ estimats the time needed the reach the stop (at location $x_{stop}$ from the bus position $x_{bus}$. $v_{max}$ is set to 40 km/h meaning that I assume that the bus goes with 40 km/h speed around the stop. It is just an naive assumption but I wanted to tackle somehow (the often) situation when the bus reports its position closely to the stop, but not excactly at the stop.\n",
